TextureArray
============

**Inherits:** :ref:`TextureLayered<class_TextureLayered>` **<** :ref:`Resource<class_Resource>` **<** :ref:`Reference<class_Reference>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

Array of textures stored in a single primitive.

Description
-----------

``TextureArray``\ s store an array of :ref:`Image<class_Image>`\ s in a single :ref:`Texture<class_Texture>` primitive. Each layer of the texture array has its own mipmap chain. This makes it is a good alternative to texture atlases.

``TextureArray``\ s must be displayed using shaders. After importing your file as a ``TextureArray`` and setting the appropriate Horizontal and Vertical Slices, display it by setting it as a uniform to a shader, for example:

::

    shader_type canvas_item;
    
    uniform sampler2DArray tex;
    uniform int index;
    
    void fragment() {
        COLOR = texture(tex, vec3(UV.x, UV.y, float(index)));
    }

Set the integer uniform "index" to show a particular part of the texture as defined by the Horizontal and Vertical Slices in the importer.
