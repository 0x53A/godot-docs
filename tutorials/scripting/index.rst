Scripting
=========

This section covers programming languages and core features to code your games
in Godot.

Here, you will find information that is not already covered in more specific
sections. For instance, to learn about inputs, we recommend you to read

The sections below each focus on a given programming language or, in GDNative's
case, an interface that works with multiple languages.
